4. Imagine that you are told that switch 1 is configured with the dynamic auto paramete for trunking on its Fa0/5 interface, which is connected to switch 2. You have to configure switch 2. Which of the following settings for trunking could allow trunking to work? (Choose two answers.)

5. A switch has just arrived from Cisco. The switch has never been configured with any VLANs, but VTP has been disabled. An engineer configures the vlan 22 and name Hannahs-VLAN commands and then exits configuration mode. Which of the following are true? (Choose two answers.)
   
   - [ ] VLAN 22 is listed in the output of the show vlan brief command.
   
   - [ ] VLAN 22 is listed in the output of the show running-config command.
   
   - [ ] VLAN 22 is not created by this process.
   
   - [ ] VLAN 22 does not exist in that switch until at least one interface is assigned to that VLAN.

6. Which of the following commands identify switch interfaces as being trunking interfaces: interfaces that currently operate as VLAN trunks? (Choose two answers.)
   
   - [ ] show interfaces
   
   - [ ] show interfaces switchport
   
   - [ ] show interfaces trunk
   
   - [ ] show trunks

7. In a switch that disables VTP, an engineer configures the commands vlan 30 and shutdown vlan 30. Which answers should be true about this switch? (Choose two answers.)
   
   - [ ] The show vlan brief command should list VLAN 30.
   
   - [ ] The show running-config command should list VLAN 30.
   
   - [ ] The switch should forward frames that arrive in access ports in VLAN 30.
   
   - [ ] The switch should forward frames that arrive in trunk ports tagged with VLAN 30.

8. The show interfaces g0/1 trunk command provides three lists of VLAN IDs. Which items would limit the VLANs that appear in the first of the three lists of VLANs?
   
   - [ ] A shutdown vlan 30 global command
   
   - [ ] A switchport trunk allowed vlan interface subcommand
   
   - [ ] An STP choice to block on G0/1
   
   - [ ] A no vlan 30 global command

###  VLAN Routing with Router 802.1Q Trunks
1. Router 1 has a Fast Ethernet interface 0/0 with IP address 10.1.1.1. The interface is con- nected to a switch. This connection is then migrated to use 802.1Q trunking. Which of the following commands could be part of a valid configuration for Router 1’s Fa0/0 interface? (Choose two answers.)

###  VLAN Routing with Layer 3 Switch SVIs

###  VLAN Routing with Layer 3 Switch Routed Ports
 5. A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1, G0/2, and G0/3 in the channel. Which of the following are true about SW1’s configuration to make the channel be able to route IPv4 packets correctly? (Choose two answers.)
    - [x] The ip address command must be on the port-channel 1 interface.
    - [ ] The ip address command must be on interface G0/1 (lowest numbered port).
    - [x] The port-channel 1 interface must be configured with the no switchport command.
    - [ ] Interface G0/1 must be configured with the routedport command.

6. A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)
    - [ ] A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
    - [x] A different speed (speed value)
    - [x] A default setting for switchport (switchport)
